# BitcoinNN

This is a Project that uses single layer neural network and Logistic regression to predict the growth rate of bicoin price

Data is obtained from Quandl (Now Nasdaq)

This project is an very first attempt of applying machine learning to Bitcoin price as an undergraduate. Many aspects of the data cleaning could have been taken care by packages unknown to me at the time. Additionally, Cross Validation was not implemented in this project.

Data Cleaning is done by Python
Neural Network is done by MATLAB 

This project is an implementation  of Andrew Ng's machine learning course. It is also the project for UCI Math Finance Summer 2021 Project. 

The best accuracy obtained was around 60 percent
